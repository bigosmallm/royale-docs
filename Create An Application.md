# Create an Application

The easiest way to create a Royale application is to start with an existing one and modify it.  In the examples folder are several examples you can use as a starting point.  But if you want to know more about the underlying principles, read on.

This document is divided into several sections:

[Application Structure](/create-an-application/application-structure.md) explains the important files that typically comprise an application and what they do.

[Application Tutorial](create-an-application/application-tutorial.html) is a step-by-step example of building an application.

[Migrate an Existing App](create-an-application/migrate-an-existing-app.html) provides strategies and techniques when migrating existing Flex apps to Royale, and how to switch to Royale if you already have a Javascript application.

[Security](create-an-application/security.html) provides more information about making sure hackers can't use your app to be malicous and about dealing with common security restrictions when your app wants to access external resources.

[Modules](create-an-application/modules.html) discusses how to break your application into pieces so it doesn't have to all get downloaded at once.  Or have the whole thing compiled at once.

[Royale code conventions](create-an-application/royale-code-conventions.html) explains the typical ways Royale developers name files, classes, function, variables and more.
